These versions of the `drangreport.sty` and `drangsymbols.sty` are modified versions of the LaTeX style files originally written by Dr. Drang and posted at [http://www.https://github.com/drdrang/drangreport/](github.com/drdrang/drangreport/).

These files are mostly used for typing lectures notes in an undergraduate mathematics course. Thus, the symbols and shortcuts are chosen primarily to allow me to write as fast as I can during lectures.

It's a hassle to install fonts and compile with LaTeX, so I use XeLaTeX. This allows me a much wider variety of fonts with minimal effort.

Large sections of the original code are unchanged; these are mostly superficial edits.
